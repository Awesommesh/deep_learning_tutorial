# Basic Deep Learning Tutorial (PyTorch)

Please install `conda` (for Python 3!) first: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html

Open Anaconda Navigator, click on Environments, click on "play" button for an environment, choose "Open Terminal".

Or if you already have conda working in your terminal, go to your terminal directly.

Then use the following commands to install necessary packages (if using pip, replace `conda` with `pip`):
1. `conda install jupyter`
2. `conda install numpy`
3. `conda install matplotlib`
4. go to pytorch.org and select a proper command for your computer to install pytorch

Open Anaconda Navigator, click on Environments, click on "play" button for your environment, and choose "Open with Jupyter Notebook".

Or go to your terminal, change directory to your cloned repository, and type in `jupyter notebook`.

Open `deep_learning_tutorial_0.ipynb` in the pop-up browser.
